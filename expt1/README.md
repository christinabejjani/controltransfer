# Experiment 1:

Our goal was to test whether learned stimulus-control state associations would transfer across related stimuli. To this end, we adapted the experimental design from Wimmer and Shohamy (2012): our task consisted of a stimulus-stimulus (S-S) association phase, a stimulus-control (S-C) association phase, and a stimulus-control transfer (S-CT) test phase. In the S-S phase, face or house (S1) images repeatedly preceded the presentation of nature scene (S2) images, in order to foster S1-S2 paired-associates in memory. Next, in the S-C phase, S2 images preceded color-word stimuli in a Stroop task. Crucially, S2 images served as implicit probabilistic cues: half were predictive of congruent trials (low control-demand) and the other half were predictive of incongruent trials (high control-demand). Finally, in the S-CT phase, S1 images, instead of S2 images, preceded the Stroop stimuli but did not have any predictive relationship with congruency. This allowed us to test whether any S2 control-demand associations acquired during the S-C phase would transfer to their S1 paired-associates. Control transfer learning would be evident if S1 images associated with S2 high control-demand images produced a smaller congruency effect in the transfer phase compared to S1 images associated with S2 low control-demand images.
