# Javascript Files:

For these experiments, to counterbalance the assignment of paired-associates, we ran four task versions. You'll see four corresponding folders with each of the different task versions. The code should not be different; the only difference between the folders is what file is named as S1_1, S1_2, etc.

These experiments were run on Amazon Mechanical Turk and were thus coded in Javascript.

You can also see the JavaScript files in action:
