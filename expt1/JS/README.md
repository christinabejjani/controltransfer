*Please contact me at christina.bejjani AT duke.edu if you are planning on using this code for an experiment.* I have since updated the code in a variety of ways that I had not anticipated when I ran this experiment.

This experiment was run in March 2017 on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

To counterbalance the assignment of paired-associates, we ran four task versions. You'll see four corresponding folders with each of the different task versions. The code should not be different; the only difference between the folders is what file is named as S1_1, S1_2, etc. To run the experiment, you would download the task folder and list the Main Menu file as the "Survey Link" on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
