    "# Information on How These Data Are Organized:\n",
    "\n",
    "`TypeOfResponse` refers to whether participants pressed a button (\"SCResp\") or did not press a button (\"SCRespITI\" / \"SCITIResp\") within the given time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Version` refers to the task version. I never changed the JS code; I merely changed which face/house was labeled as S1_1, S1_2, S1_3, or S1_4 in respective task folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LogCounter` gets added to whenever the JS records a new datapoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TrialCounter` gets added to whenever a new trial has started. This is reset at the start of each block.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MatrixCounter` gets added to throughout the task and is never reset. It is what I use to call Stimuli #s.\n",
    "\n",
    "`RunCounter` refers to the run: 0 is run 1, 1 is run 2, 2 is run 3, and 3 is run 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CongruentCounter` marks any time a congruent trial occurred; `IncongruentCounter` an incongruent trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "`StimPresented` refers to which scene was presented before the trial. This is in reference to the main manipulation of the S-C association phase, whereby particular scenes are more likely to precede specific proportions of congruent/incongruent trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "`StimProbAll` refers to my matrix of possible trial types. So it indicates whether \"RED\" will be shown in red, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TrialType` also marks incongruent/congruent trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CongruentNumber` refers to my specially made matrices of my congruent trials. So there are 4 possible incongruent combinations, with 160 total congruent trials, and thus 40 occurrences of numbers 1-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "`IncongruentNumber` refers to my specially made matrix of incongruent trials. There are 12 possible incongruent combinations, with 160 trial incongruent trials, and thus around 13 of each occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PressCorrect` refers to the button that participants should press on that trial. This is how I define accuracy (i.e., correct: when PressCorrect = actualkeyPressed).\n",
    "\n",
    "`ResponseMatrix` refers to which key is pressed; this is a redundant variable and was used to make sure that each key had been required an equal number of times throughout the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ActualKeyPressed` is what key subjects pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Accuracy` & `RT` self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`FeedbackType` refers to whether they got correct as fb, incorrect as fb, or the fb time-out.\n",
    "\n",
    "`runStart` refers to the initiation of the countdown to begin the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ImagePresent` refers to when scene was presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "`StimTime` refers to when the color word was presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "`RespOnset` refers to when a response was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AccCount` is how I give subjects accurate fb of their performance at the end of each run (i.e., a counter that gets added to after each correct trial & is divided by trial #).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Subject` self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other labels aren't coded in the JS: `Sequential` refers to whether a trial was the same (0) as before, changed to incongruent or congruent on the next trial, etc., and `StimRep` looks for direct repetitions in the StimProbAll matrix. These were coded in Matlab and added to the CSV file.\n",

This would result from learning to associate a state of higher attentional focus with the high control-demand cue, which in turn means more efficient processing - or responding quicker to incongruent trials and potentially slower to congruent trials."
