# Analysis of Expt 1:

* Here, you'll find:
  * the Jupyter notebooks that include analyses for all phases (S-S, S-C, S-CT) of expt 1 data (**Note**: The post-test data is analyzed in the S-S phase Jupyter notebook);
  * the organized SPSS file, if you like looking at data that way.

Please note that there are a few analyses not in my Jupyter notebooks: 1) ANOVAs on the S-C learners/nonlearners & 2) Contingency learning ANOVAS. These are not intentional exclusions; I intend to come back and update these notebooks with a conversion of wide-form data to long-form data for #1 analysis & data exclusion filtering for #2 analysis. Everything else should be included.
