# Analysis of Expt 1:

* Here, you'll find:
  * the Jupyter notebooks that include analyses for all phases (S-S, S-C, S-CT) of expt 1 data (**Note**: The post-test data is analyzed in the S-S phase Jupyter notebook);
  * the organized SPSS file, if you like looking at data that way, + specific SPSS files for the contingency learning analysis

Please note that there are a few analyses not in my Jupyter notebooks: 1) ANOVAs on the S-C learners/nonlearners. This is not an intentional exclusion; I intend to come back and update these notebooks with a conversion of wide-form data to long-form data for #1 analysis. Everything else should be included, and this analysis can be performed using the SPSS files uploaded here.
