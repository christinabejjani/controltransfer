# Post-test Questionnaire:

The same questionnaires were given for participants in experiments 1, 2, and 3 to keep time on task similar and have exact comparisons of responses, though we did not make any predictions as to whether scrambling the paired associates (Expt 2) would affect the post-test questionnaire results of Expt 1. Also, for Expt 3, rather than provide mturk ID, they provided their subject ID (which the JS told them).
