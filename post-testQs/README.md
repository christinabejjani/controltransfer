# Post-test Questionnaire:

The same questionnaires were given for participants in experiments 1 & 2 to keep time on task similar and have exact comparisons of responses, though we did not make any predictions as to whether scrambling the paired associates (Expt 2) would affect the post-test questionnaire results of Expt 1.

These questionnaires are organized so that on the memory test, the correct answers were always 2 1 1 2 (i.e., right left left right). This made it easier for me to code, though I also just recoded the values in Qualtrics.

The S-C and S-CT forced choice responses were also designed so that the high control-demand cue/transfer probes were the leftmost options.
