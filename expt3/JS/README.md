*Please contact me at christina.bejjani AT duke.edu if you are planning on using this code for an experiment.* I have since updated the code in a variety of ways that I had not anticipated when I ran this experiment.

To counterbalance the assignment of paired-associates, we ran four task versions. You'll see four corresponding folders with each of the different task versions. The code should not be different; the only difference between the folders is what file is named as S1_1, S1_2, etc.

This experiment was run in the lab, on the same computer, from September to November 2017. To run this experiment, you would download the folder, put it somewhere where html is public (published on github? dropbox? or if your university has a personal home directory, as Duke does), and type in https:// before the main menu link (it must be https:// and not http://; https will not work.).
