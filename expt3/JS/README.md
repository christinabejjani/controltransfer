# Javascript Files:

To counterbalance the assignment of paired-associates, we ran four task versions. You'll see four corresponding folders with each of the different task versions. The code should not be different; the only difference between the folders is what file is named as S1_1, S1_2, etc.

These experiments were run in the lab, on the same computer, using JavaScript.

You can also see the JavaScript files in action:
* Main Menu file: https://people.duke.edu/~cb383/SCP_R/v1/MenuFinal_v1.html (Just replace v1 with v2 / 3 / 4 to get the other versions).
  1. Note: To view the S-S Phase, open the JavaScript Console, type updateMainMenu(1); for the S-C Phase, type updateMainMenu(2); for the S-CT Phase, type updateMainMenu(3); for the debriefing, type updateMainMenu(4).
  1. This is the MOST up to date version of this control transfer task. I combined all the instructions files within their individual task phase files, and combined the S-C Phase with its practice phase as well.
  1. You must put https://. http:// will result in an error. So will viewing any of the tasks outside of the main menu file (because I assign values to variables based on the Main Menu file).
