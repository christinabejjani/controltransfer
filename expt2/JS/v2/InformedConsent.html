<p> The purpose of this study is to investigate how the demands on attention (like task difficulty) affect memory. </p>

<p> <b>Procedure:</b> In this experiment, you will be presented with visual images (e.g., images of fractals, faces, 
houses, words, as well as Arabic numerals), which will require you to press a key depending on the current task instructions. 
For instance, you may be asked to detect an upside-down face image via a button response.

Once you are finished with the task, you will also be asked to fill out a few questionnaires about your attitudes and 
state of mind during the experiment. If any item on the questionnaires makes you uncomfortable, feel free to skip it, 
but please try to answer as many of the questions as you can.

Based on our piloting, this task should take about 70 minutes to complete.
